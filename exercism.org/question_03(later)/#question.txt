Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

lumberjacks
background
downstream
six-year-old
The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.



LOGIC : 
1) create an function named isogram(input an string and output t/f), and another one to change uppercase letter to lowercase ; 
2) an array[26] to store all the index of alphabet and set them to 0 ; 
3) iterate thru all the characters of input strings and : check for alphabet and then change it's uppercase to lowercase ; 
4) check cooresponding index in array if value at index is already 1 return false, else set the value to 1. 
5) if string endsa nd none of 'em chars repeated then return true ;
